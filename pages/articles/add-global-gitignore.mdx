title: Create a global .gitignore file

Sometimes we need ignore some files for our own development environment. We could check
add them to the `.gitignore` in our repositories. But not all the collaborators share
the same development environment. So we should want to keep our `.gitignore` generic for
our projects.

For example, I use [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) as my Python
[LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) server for my Emacs and I
need to add a `pyrightconfig.json`. I also need this for all my Python related
projects. Not everyone uses Pyright and I don't want to add `pyrightconfig.json` to the
`.gitignore` files in every Python repository I work on. So ignore it globally is a
better way to deal with this problem.

You can also create a global `.gitignore` file to define a list of rules for ignoring
files in every Git repository on your computer.

Open your favourite terminal application or Emacs ;) Create a `~/.gitignore_global` file
and add the items you want to ignore globally here. Eg. `pyrightconfig.json` or
'.DS_Store'.

Then configure Git to use the exclude file `~/.gitignore_global` for all Git
repositories.

```shell
$ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

That's it, no more repeatedly adding those environment-specific `.gitignore` rules.
