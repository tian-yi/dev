title: Markdown reference

Though I use Markdown often, I admit that I don't write enough of it to
remember all the syntax. I often I find myself googling Markdown syntax. So I
decided to write up a quick reference guide for Markdown syntax. I normally
write Markdown using the [Github Flavour
Markdown(GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

And you can find very good documentation on writing on Github at the
[Github doc site](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github).


## Headings

```
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6
```
# h1
## h2
### h3
#### h4
##### h5
###### h6

## Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

## Styling text

### Bold
```
** ** or __ __
The **word** or __words__ you want to make bold.
```
The **word** or __words__ you want to make bold.

### Italics
```
* * or _ _
The *word* or _words_ are italicized.
```
The *word* or _words_ you are italicized.

### Strikethrough
```
~~ ~~
~~This was mistaken text~~
```
~~This was mistaken text~~

### Bold and nested italic
```
** ** and _ _
**This text is _extremely_ important**
```
**This text is _extremely_ important**

###
```
*** ***
***All this text is important***
```
***All this text is important***

## Quoting text
### Simple blockquotes
To create a block quote, all you have to do is preface a line with the "greater than" caret (>)
```
Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo:
> It’s been frustrating - we’ve played good football and were unfortunate against Man Utd, but I don’t think that takes away from the performance of the team.
```
Wolves head coach Nuno Espirito Santo:
> It’s been frustrating - we’ve played good football and were unfortunate against Man Utd, but I don’t think that takes away from the performance of the team.

### Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs
You can also place a caret character on each line of the quote. This is particularly useful if your quote spans multiple paragraphs.
```
> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature.
>
> —Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
>
> Cranly did not answer.
```

> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature.
>
> —Of whom are you speaking? Stephen asked at length.
>
> Cranly did not answer.

Block quotes can contain other Markdown elements, such as italics, images, or links.

## Links
### Inline Links
```
[This is a link](https://github.com)
[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
```
[This is a link](https://github.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

You can also add other styles to the text in the link
```
[This is **_ also a link_**](https://github.com)
```
[This is **_also a link_**](https://github.com)

### Reference Links
```
Here's [a link to something else][another place].
Here's [yet another link][another-link].
And now back to [the first link][another place].

[another place]: www.github.com
[another-link]: www.google.com
```

## Lists
### Unordered list
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.
```
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes
```
* Flour
* Cheese
* Tomatoes

## Ordered list
To order your list, precede each line with a number.
```
1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl
```

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

## Nested Lists
Occasionally, you might find the need to make a list with more depth, or, to nest one list within another. All you have to do is to remember to indent each asterisk one space more than the preceding item.
```
* Tintin
 * A reporter
 * Has poofy orange hair
 * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
 * A sea captain
 * Has a fantastic beard
 * Loves whiskey
   * Possibly also scotch?
```
* Tintin
 * A reporter
 * Has poofy orange hair
 * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
 * A sea captain
 * Has a fantastic beard
 * Loves whiskey
   * Possibly also scotch?

## Adding Elements in Lists
Indent the element more than the list item it nested in also with a line break above.

### Adding Paragraphs or quotes
```
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

  I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

  > Here's a quote.
```
* This is the first list item.
* Here's the second list item.

  I need to add another paragraph below the second list item.

* And here's the third list item.

  > Here's a quote.

### Github Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].
```
- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request
```
- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request

If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:
```
- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue
```
- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue

## Horizontal Rules
To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
```
***

---

_________________

Try to put a blank line before...

---

...and after a horizontal rule.

Without blank lines, this would be a heading.
---
Don't do this!

## Code
### Inline Code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
```
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
### Code Block
To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
### Code Block with syntax highlighting
Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't. However, many renderers -- like Github's and Markdown Here -- support syntax highlighting.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

## Tables
TTables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM.

### Creating a table
You can create tables with pipes | and hyphens -. Hyphens are used to create each column's header, while pipes separate each column. You must include a blank line before your table in order for it to correctly render.
```
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
```
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

The pipes on either end of the table are optional.

Cells can vary in width and do not need to be perfectly aligned within columns. There must be at least three hyphens in each column of the header row.
```
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |
```
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| git status | List all new or modified files |
| git diff | Show file differences that haven't been staged |

### Formatting content within your table
You can use formatting such as links, inline code blocks, and text styling within your table:
```
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |
```
| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

### Colons can be used to align columns
You can align text to the left, right, or center of a column by including colons : to the left, right, or on both sides of the hyphens within the header row.
```
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |
```
| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

### Escape the pipe |
To include a pipe | as content within your cell, use a \ before the pipe:
```
| Name     | Character |
| ---      | ---       |
| Backtick | `         |
| Pipe     | \|        |
```
| Name     | Character |
| ---      | ---       |
| Backtick | `         |
| Pipe     | \|        |

## Inilne HTML
You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.
```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
```
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>
